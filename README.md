My Portfolio

This is an about me page that I have created as part of my Manchester Codes coursework. 

I update the content frequently to reflect my current state in the learning process. Therefore, I would request you check this frequently
for changes. The same can be said for the Portfolio page. These projects
will change in quantity and quality as I progress on my development journey. As a great philosopher once said,
