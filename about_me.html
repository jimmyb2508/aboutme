                <h1 class="aboutme">About Me</h1>
                <p class="aboutjb">My name is James Barrington and I am a 34 year old aspiring front-end developer from Manchester. 
                    I am currently studying with Manchester Codes as part of their #september19 cohort. 
                    <br><br>
                    I have studied at Salford University and the Open Unverisity graduating with two honours degrees. I have an aspiration
                    to study for a Masters degree in Computer Science some time in the future. I have a strong commercial background with over ten years experience in 
                    an account management role for a large UK based corporate. This has allowed me to combine advanced problem solving skills 
                    with a client focussed approach, which I now apply to developing professional software solutions.
                    <br><br>
                    In my spare time I enjoy listening to music and playing the guitar and bass guitar. My musical taste is eclectic so you may find me at 
                    Matt & Phred's one night listening to jazz and blues; the Bridgewater Hall on another listening to classical; and on a Saturday 
                    night i'll most likely be down the pub listening to a rock band.
                    <br><br>
                    I like to keep fit and swim regularly as well as riding my road and mountain bikes whenever I can. 
                    The hardest thing I have ever done - besides learning to code - was climbing Mont Blanc in France. Standing
                    at 4,810 meters high it is the highest mountain in Western Europe.</p>
