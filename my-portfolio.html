    <h1>About Me (Under Construction)</h1>
    <img src = /Users/jamesbarrington/Github/Projects/my-portfolio/me.jpg alt="My Portrait" height="200" width="200">
    <p>I am a 34 year old software engineer from Manchester. I am currently studying with 
        Manchester Codes as part of their #september19 cohort. I have graduated with two honours
        degrees from two different universities and have a strong commercial background 
        spanning ten years. This experience has allowed me to combine advanced problem solving skills
        with a client focussed approach, which I now apply to developing professional software
        solutions.

        <h5>Interests</h5>
        <p>I am a keen mountaineer having summited the highest mountain in Western Europe, Mont Blanc, twice. 
            I am also a keen cyclist and enjoy road and mountain biking. My greatest cycling achievement was 
            completing the end-to-end ride on the UK in 2018. I enjoy listening to different types of music and 
            play the guitar and bass.</p>
