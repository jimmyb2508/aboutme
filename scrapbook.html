<h1>My name is James Barrington and I am a 34 year old aspiring front-end developer from Manchester. 
    I am currently studying with Manchester Codes as part of their #september19 cohort. Previously I studied at Salford University 
    and the Open Unverisity graduating with two honours degrees. I have a strong commercial background with over ten years experience
    in account management for a UK based corporate. This experience has allowed me to combine advanced problem solving skills
    with a client focussed approach, which I now apply to developing professional software solutions.</h1>

        <h5>Interests</h5>
        <p>I am a keen mountaineer having summited the highest mountain in Western Europe, Mont Blanc, twice. 
            I am also a keen cyclist and enjoy road and mountain biking. My greatest cycling achievement was 
            completing the end-to-end ride on the UK in 2018. I enjoy listening to different types of music and 
            play the guitar and bass.</p>
